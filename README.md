# Project 3 - Data app with user filter

With this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to collect user input, use it to construct an API url, and present sophisticated UI results to the user.  You'll also demonstrate your ability to research and incorporate tags and libraries we've not yet covered.

Check the requirements and the hints, and ask questions in Piazza.

## Requirements

1. Use the Bootstrap __4__ Jumbotron template.

2. Use the City of Chicago Food Inspection data set.

3. In the Jumbotron, provide form input elements to let users filter the data by inspection date, facility type, status and zip.  The blue button should display the word __Search__ with a search icon.

4. Your app should have 3 screens:  input form, styled text results, and map results.

5. Your results screens should indicate how many results were returned.

## Hint

Ask questions.

I don't expect that you know how to accomplish the result, so ask questions, early and often.

Some things you'll want to explore:

`$.param()`

The Socrata API Docs for the Food Inspection data set.
